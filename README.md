# CS 131 Fall 2023: Project Starter

Welcome to the Brewin Interpreter series, a quarter-long project in CS131 with one goal: making an interpreter. This repository contains the source code for different iterations of this interpreter. Each version incrementally supports features of the Brewin programming language, a fictional language inspired by C++, Python, and EMACS Lisp.

## Projects Overview

The repository contains interpreters for different iterations of the Brewin language, each adding new features and capabilities:

**Project 1: Brewin v1 Interpreter**
- **Features:**
  - Executes a single `main()` function.
  - Supports integer and string data types.
  - Implements basic arithmetic operations: addition and subtraction.
  - Handles variable assignments and printing to the console.
  - Interprets expressions involving variables and constants.

**Project 2: Brewin v2 Interpreter**
- **Features:**
  - Introduces control structures like if-else statements and while loops for advanced flow control.
  - Adds support for defining and invoking multiple user-defined functions.
  - Enhances the language with additional data types and arithmetic operations.
  - Establishes basic error handling mechanisms for improved program robustness.
  - Implements local and global scoping rules to manage variable visibility and lifetimes effectively.
    
**Project 3: Brewin++ Interpreter**
- **Features:**
  - Introduces first-class functions, allowing functions to be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.
  - Adds support for lambda functions and closures, enhancing the language's capability for functional programming.
  - Implements pass-by-reference parameter passing, alongside the original pass-by-value.
  - Incorporates limited type coercions, broadening the flexibility in operations and comparisons.

**Project 4: Brewin# Interpreter**
- **Features:**
  - Adds Object-Oriented Programming capabilities to the Brewin language.
  - Enables object creation, field/method addition, and method invocation, without the need for predefined classes.
  - Implements prototypal inheritance allowing object behaviors and attributes to be shared.
  - Supports enhanced closure functionalities, capturing variables by value or reference based on their types.
  - Facilitates the manipulation of objects, including passing by value or reference and deep copy returns.

This project demonstrates my ability to extend programming language features and interpret complex object-oriented constructs.
